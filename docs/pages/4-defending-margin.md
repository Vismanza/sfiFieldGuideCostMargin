#Â Defending Margin

This secion covers setting up margin upper and lower bounds. This results in runtime validation on a cart where margin needs to be in a defined range.

The range is defined in a matrix at a product level.

Separate to the margin bounds you can define limits on adjustments using vistual context scope on AdjustmentData. This allows you limit the % adjustment (or total discount) on any transaction.

These two feature in conjunction offer fine grained control in order to ensure order capture does not result in bad deals.
